## Introduction
This repository presents various state observers and estimators for linear systems (preferably controllable).
It is based on state estimation theory and contains the following observers :
- Open Loop Observer
- Closed Loop Observer
- Unknown Input Observers
- Proportional Integral (PI) Observer
- Kalman Estimation using the Kalman Filter and the Linear Quadratic Estimator


## Project Contents
The project includes the following components:

- **Source Code:** A MATLAB script file that computes all the necessary matrices and gains. It is devided into sections for each observer, and the same system is used for most of them. You can access it [here](./script.m).

- **Simulation File:** A Simulink file that contains all the observers and the associated signals. To visualise them please log the signals and use the Data Inspector directly. You can access the simulation file [here](./simulation.slx).
